When Richard discovered the theft, he confronted Marcus privately and threatened to reveal everything at tonight's gallery opening.

James Morrison witnessed Marcus near the glass but didn't understand the significance until after Richard's death. The empty vial was hastily hidden behind a potted plant, and Marcus hoped to destroy the financial evidence in the study before anyone could find it."
